					<h3>Our investment philosophy</h3>
				</div>
				<p></p>
				<p>Over the years, we’ve found that investors consistently struggle to receive the investment returns they should.

Our unique investment philosophy approach is the result of their research.</p>

				<h2 class="title title_sec sec-info-3__title">How is our approach different</h2>
				<p class="text-info-2">We are often not aware of it, but our emotions – rather than practical reasoning – are the biggest driver of our investment decisions.<br>
				The tradition of creating an investment portfolio focuses almost entirely on an investor’s attitude to risk and ignores the emotional factors at work. Our investment philosophy approach measures several aspects of an investor’s personality that relate to their financial behaviour and decision-making. We believe this enables us to develop more effective individual investment solutions that reduce the negative impact on returns caused by investor emotions.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="sec-plan__content wrap-article text-info-2">
				<div class="wrap-article__hide">
					<h4>1990, beginning</h4>
					<p>Our story began in September 1990 when a young Liverpoodlian called George Petch set up financial consultancy company in the heart of European community — Brussels, Belgium, with the aim of building long-term relationships and providing holistic advice to fit in with people’s busy lifestyles and changing circumstances.</p>
					<p>Prior to this, for many years, George had been working within the Life Assurance industry in the UK and became dissatisfied with the levels of service clients received as well as being totally disenchanted with the constant broken promised expectations.</p>
					<p>This established the foundation upon which GPI would be built — delivering on promises and a diligent client service.</p>
					<p>GPI consolidated their position in Brussels and gradually expanded their operation to neighborouring countries.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h4>2004, first international experience</h4>
					<p>On 15th July 2004 the Moscow office was established in Smolensky Passage, Moscow, Russia.</p>
					<p>A Personal Wealth Management services for Russia in 2004 was an exotic prospect. With an abundance of local banks offering low level expertise and non-existent client protection, it seemed that the new market had a great potential, especially given the fact that the growing Russian middle class were getting more demanding in terms of the financial solutions and products.</p>
					<p>So, using the years of experience and access to the first class highly regulated financial products, the GPI presence grew rapidly. From Moscow office company was operating within the entire Russian market, Kazakhstan and Ukraine.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h4>2009, success in the profession, launch of Asset Management</h4>
					<p>On 20th February 2009 the internal GPI investment team formed a new asset management company called Mithril Asset Management.</p>
					<p>Rapid growth of company’s assets under management paved the way for GPI to consider the formation of an independent asset management team, whose role would be to bring active day-to-day management.</p>
					<p>Right from the outset, Mithril’s attitude was based on understanding that every investor should be treated individually as no two scenarios are the same. Mithril’s independence allows them to choose most asset classes from practically the entire investment universe, from stocks or bonds to ETF’s or structured notes.</p>
					<p>They have grown into a global asset management company with worldwide presence, long history and great strength and depth with a team that includes investment professionals with expertise in capital market research, investment strategy design, liability management, derivatives and portfolio management.</p>
					<p>At Mithril, they pride themselves on offering truly bespoke asset management.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h4>2014, aggravation of the sanction crisis in Russia </h4>
					<p>After several years of restrictions and dealing with the debt crisis the Russian market was becoming continually more difficult and it became clear that keeping savings in rubles was extremely dangerous; for majority of Russians in was too late as in the matter of 6 months the ruble declined in value by 100% to all major currencies. In addition of that, majority of expatriates were leaving the country together with their companies closing the business in Russia.</p>
					<p>Whilst the deficit of financial advice was frightening, most locals were not ready for long-term investment planning, with the culture of spending «here and now» plus the lack of trust in financial institutions, it all made the</p>
					<p>It was time to rethink the viability of the Russian GPI operation. During next years the global market conditions were studied, latest legislations were investigated and future business model was reconsidered.</p>
					<p>These conditions perfectly pushed forward the right decision to produce a further evolution of the company — clear division of European and International business, both in terms of the legislations and services/products.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h4>2018, expansion of the company, creation of GPI Europe</h4>
					<p>Therefore, it was decided to develop the European company, which will meet all the recent EU requirements.</p>
					<p>GPI Europe began its operations on 1st of January 2018 to answer the investment needs of people living within the European Community and so the head office of International company was moved to Zurich, Switzerland and European office was opened in Bratislava, Slovakia. Utilizing the experience of the international company, GPI Europe’s objective is to satisfy the aims and goals of its investors. The company is delighted to provide a comprehensive range of services to clients and their families.</p>
					<p>The company’s portfolio contains a wide variety of solutions:</p>
					<p>— insurance, family protecting from unforeseen circumstances;</p>
					<p>— optimization of ownership and assets management, allowing to protect assets and carry out international tax planning;</p>
					<p>— solutions to ensure a controlled and efficient transfer of assets to heirs, etc.</p>
					<p>The logical result of business development is the construction of a family office, within which all generations of the client’s family can be served. The company’s products and services are offered solely on the basis of a personal or family financial plan. When working with a client, the greatest importance is attached to their life priorities. The company provides its clients with an exclusive range of services, significantly exceeding the level of service in traditional Private Banking.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h4>2019, formation of a united team, new partnership policy</h4>
					<p>In 2019, a new stage in the development of the company’s partner network began. One of the main problems of solo financial consultants is that one person cannot know everything, cannot be a professional in all areas. The solution to that was a formation of a team of highly specialised professionals, where, on the one hand, each client has its own independent financial consultant, on another, experts in different areas can be involved in solving the client’s problems: from capital structuring to individual investment instruments.</p>
					<p>That year was marked by a qualitative expansion of the product line. After analysing the proposals of available financial institutions, it was decided to use the only ones which will fill in the criteria of «price» and «quality».</p>
					<p></p>
					<h4>2020, moving to office in Bratislava</h4>
					<p>On February 2020, the augmented team has moved to the larger office in Bratislava.During lockdown the internal education program was launched for people either new to this career or for additional professional education. A separate department for clients support and capital structuring appeared, the team was joined by a professionals from several EU member states, it exceeds 20 people and continues to grow.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h4>Evolution towards new technologies and reality</h4>
					<p>The Covid-19 crises forced the GPI group, as many other companies, to review existing business model, in order to deal with new reality (global lockdown).</p>
					<p>The company structured its services for a new, online, format of working with clients. This was done in order to be able to make the most efficient use of the market opportunities available for remote opening and maintenance of investment accounts, as well as to provide the best service for the growing flow of clients from different European member states and other countries.</p>
					<p>New standards allowed for a more efficient use of time and kept the same high quality of the services, regardless of where the client resided. As a result, the 2020 quarantine measures did not affect the company’s development dynamics and brout great investment return to the clients.</p>
					<p>Remote working has now become strong factor and will influences the ability for future business relations.</p>
